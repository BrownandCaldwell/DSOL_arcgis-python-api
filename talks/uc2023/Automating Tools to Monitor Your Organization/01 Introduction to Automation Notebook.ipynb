    "1. Build Automation: Build automation involves automating the process of compiling source code, packaging binaries, and creating software builds. \n",
    "    + Tools like Apache Maven, Gradle, or Jenkins can be used to define build scripts that automatically compile, test, and package the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test Automation: Test automation focuses on automating the execution of software tests. \n",
