    "One request the Python API team has heard repeatedly from Web GIS administrators: What's the best way to move my content from a development Enterprise or organization to staging to production?\n",
    "\n",
    "This Guide provides one possible roadmap for how to get content from one Web GIS to another - a template for demonstrating basic software concepts when transferring content so the workflow can be modified for other types of content and tailored for an administrator's particular need. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [`clone_items()`](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html#arcgis.gis.ContentManager.clone_items) function on the ContentManger aims to create an exact duplicate of one item with all its uses and functionality from an original organizational deployment, whether ArcGIS Online, Enteprise, or Kubernetes to a second organizational deployment. The relationship between any supported, related, or resource items to the items being cloned must be considered when cloning an item. \n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about cloning items, let's establish some basic terminology.  Cloning can refer to the transfer of items between any organizational deployment, from either ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS Online, or ArcGIS Enterprise for Kubernetes to any other deployment type. Rather than tangling ourselves up when trying to distinguish between these portal types while writing about them, we'll refer to organization where the content originates as the _source_ regardless of deployment type. We'll consider the organization to which we'll clone content as the _target_. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document illustrates the workflow of gathering _source_ items using a source administrator account, and cloning them into a _target_ administrator account.  More specifically, this guide walks through an approach of cloning [`hosted feature layers`](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/hosted-web-layers.htm) and [`web maps`](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/web-maps/). `Web Maps` can consume these layer items and their source services as operational layer building blocks. For information on each of these item types, please click the hyperlinks for each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an administrator workflow. Using administrator accounts guarantees all necessary privileges within the _source_ to access the item and any dependencies and within the _target_ to create the services and items. The target administrator subsequently can create user accounts and reassign item ownership and/or group membership according to need. This might also be the simplest workflow when the portal has users managed by an external identity store."
