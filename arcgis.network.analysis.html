<dd><p>This ArcGIS Online service solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a
fleet of vehicles. It is similar to <cite>solve_vehicle_routing_problem</cite>, but <cite>edit_vehicle_routing_problem</cite>
is designed to make a few, small edits to the results of a VRP and re-solve or solve a small VRP
analysis of only two routes.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><strong>Parameter</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>orders</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000).
These are the locations that the routes of the vehicle routing
problem (VRP) analysis should visit. An order can represent a
delivery (for example, furniture delivery), a pickup (such as an
airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service
or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for
instance).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>depots</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. These represent the location where the routes
will start and end at for the routes.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>routes</p></td>
<td><p>Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more routes (up to 100). A route
specifies vehicle and driver characteristics; after solving, it also
represents the path between depots and orders.</p>
<p>A route can have start and end depot service times, a fixed or
flexible starting time, time-based operating costs, distance-based
operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a
driver’s workday, and so on. When specifying the routes, you can set
properties for each one by using attributes.</p>
</td>

<td><p>Optional <a class="reference internal" href="arcgis.features.toc.html#arcgis.features.FeatureSet" title="arcgis.features.FeatureSet"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FeatureSet</span></code></a> . These are the rest periods, or breaks, for the
routes in a given vehicle routing problem. A break is associated with
exactly one route, and it can be taken after completing an order,
while en-route to an order, or prior to servicing an order. It has a
start time and a duration, for which the driver may or may not be
paid.
There are three options for establishing when a break begins: using
a time window, a maximum travel time, or a maximum work time.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>time_units</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. The time units for all time-based field values in
the analysis.  Allowed values: <cite>Seconds</cite>, <cite>Minutes</cite>, <cite>Hours</cite>, or <cite>Days</cite></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>distance_units</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. The distance units for all distance-based field
values in the analysis. Allowed values: <cite>Meters</cite>,`Kilometers`,`Feet`,`Yards`,`Miles`,`NauticalMiles`</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>analysis_region</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Specify the region in which to perform the analysis.
If a value is not specified for this parameter, the tool will
automatically calculate the region name based on the location of the
input points.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>default_date</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Datetime. The default date for time field values that
specify a time of day without including a date.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>uturn_policy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Use this parameter to restrict or permit the service
area to make U-turns at junctions.</p>
<p>The parameter can have the following values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_UTURNS-U</cite> - turns are permitted everywhere. Allowing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>U-turns implies that the vehicle can turn around at any junction and
double back on the same street. This is the default value.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>NO_UTURNS-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at all junctions: pseudo-junctions, intersections, and dead-ends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that U-turns may be permitted even when this option is chosen.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_ONLY-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at all junctions, except those that have only one connected street feature (a dead end).</p></li>
<li><p><cite>ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_AND_INTERSECTIONS_ONLY-U</cite> - turns are prohibited at pseudo-junctions where exactly two adjacent streets meet, but U-turns are permitted</p></li>
</ul>
<p>at intersections and dead ends. This prevents turning around in the middle of the road where one length of road happened to be digitized as two street features.
The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>time_window_factor</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String. Rates the importance of honoring time windows.
Allowed values: <cite>High</cite>, <cite>Medium</cite> or <cite>Low</cite>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>spatially_cluster_routes</p></td>
<td><p>Optional Boolean. If true, the dynamic seed points are automatically
created for all routes and the orders assigned to an individual
route are spatially clustered. This will reduce route intersections.
When using <cite>route_zones</cite> set this parameter to <cite>False</cite>.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>excess_transit_factor</p></td>
<td><p>Optional String.  Rates the importance of reducing excess transit time of
order pairs. Excess transit time is the amount of time exceeding the

<dd><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">solve_vehicle_routing_problem</span></code> tool solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles.
A dispatcher managing a fleet of vehicles is often required to make decisions about vehicle routing. One such decision
involves how to best assign a group of customers to a fleet of vehicles and to sequence and schedule their visits. The
objectives in solving such vehicle routing problems (VRP) are to provide a high level of customer service by honoring
any time windows while keeping the overall operating and investment costs for each route as low as possible. The
constraints are to complete the routes with available resources and within the time limits imposed by driver work
shifts, driving speeds, and customer commitments. This method can be used to determine solutions for such complex
fleet management tasks.</p>
<p>Consider an example of delivering goods to grocery stores from a central warehouse location.
A fleet of three trucks is available at the warehouse. The warehouse operates only within a certain time window (from
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) during which all trucks must return back to the warehouse. Each truck has a capacity of 15,000
pounds, which limits the amount of goods it can carry. Each store has a demand for a specific amount of goods (
in pounds) that needs to be delivered, and each store has time windows that confine when deliveries should be made.
Furthermore, the driver can work only eight hours per day, requires a break for lunch, and is paid for the time spent
on driving and servicing the stores. The goal is to come up with an itinerary for each driver (or route) such that the
deliveries can be made while honoring all the service requirements and minimizing the total time spent on a particular
route by the driver.</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and
left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless
of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision
to approach an incident from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you
want to arrive at an incident and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1)
in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Using one of the parameter values can find different
facilities as the travel time along some streets may vary based on
the travel direction and one-way restrictions. For instance, a
facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling
from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the
facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute journey because of
different travel time in that direction. If you are setting a value for Time of Day, traffic may also cause the Facility to Incident and Incident to Facility options to return different results.</p>
<p>Fire departments commonly use the Facility to Incident
value for the parameter since they are concerned with the time it
takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of
the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more
concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach
the store; therefore, stores commonly choose Incident to Facility.</p>

hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway facilities, because drivers on long-distance
trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided.
Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p></li>

<p>Given that junctions represent street intersections and dead ends, different vehicles  may be able to turn around
at some junctions but not at others-it depends on whether the junction represents an intersection or dead end.
To accommodate, the U-turn policy parameter is implicitly specified by how many edges connect to the junction,
which is known as junction valency. The acceptable values for this parameter are listed below; each is followed
by a description of its meaning in terms of junction valency.
Allowed-U-turns are permitted at junctions with any number of connected edges. This is the default value.
Not Allowed-U-turns are prohibited at all junctions, regardless of junction valency. Note, however, that
U-turns are still permitted at network locations even when this setting is chosen; however, you can set the
individual network locations’ CurbApproach property to prohibit U-turns there as well.  Allowed only at Dead
Ends-U-turns are prohibited at all junctions, except those that have only one adjacent edge (a dead end).
Allowed only at Intersections and Dead Ends-U-turns are prohibited at junctions where exactly two adjacent edges meet
but are permitted at intersections (junctions with three or more adjacent edges) and dead ends (junctions with exactly
one adjacent edge).  Oftentimes, networks have extraneous junctions in the middle of road segments. This option

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes between
incidents and facilities. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions
cause roads to be prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using an Avoid
Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to
travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route
around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on
your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is
marked as illegal to do so. Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the
country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores
restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter).
It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.

Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle for
Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits, avoids,
or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this
parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly prefer them.
The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a
feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the
restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for ParameterName used by the tool
when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the
Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each
restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PROHIBITED (-1)- Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_HIGH (5) - It is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2) - It is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_LOW (1.3) - It is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_LOW (0.8)  - It is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

essential shape of the route and removes other points. The

Geographically Local: The Time of Day parameter refers to the time zone in which the facilities or incidents are
located.  If Time of Day Usage is set to Start Time and Travel Direction is Facility to Incident, this is the time
zone of the facilities.  If Time of Day Usage is set to Start Time and Travel Direction is Incident to Facility,
this is the time zone of the incidents.  If Time of Day Usage is set to End Time and Travel Direction is Facility

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>travel_mode</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS
Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better reflect your organization’s
workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values, and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model traveling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along
road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance.
Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car.
(What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points,
and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile
along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile,
so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values:
Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where
traffic data is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for
each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements
along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly,
to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on
roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which
is the default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based
value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">solve_location_allocation</span></code> tool chooses the best location or locations from a set of input locations. Input to this tool includes facilities,
which provide goods or services, and demand points, which consume the goods and services. The objective is to find the facilities that supply the
demand points most efficiently. The tool solves this problem by analyzing various ways the demand points can be assigned to the different facilities.
The solution is the scenario that allocates the most demand to facilities and minimizes overall travel. The output includes the solution facilities,
demand points associated with their assigned facilities, and lines connecting demand points to their facilities. The location-allocation tool can be
configured to solve specific problem types. Examples include the following: A retail store wants to see which potential store locations would need to
be developed to capture 10 percent of the retail market in the area. A fire department wants to determine where it should locate fire stations to reach
90 percent of the community within a four-minute response time. A police department wants to preposition personnel given past criminal activity at night.
After a storm, a disaster response agency wants to find the best locations to set up triage facilities, with limited patient capacities, to tend to the
affected population.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Candidate) - A facility that may be part of the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Required) - A facility that must be part of the solution.</p></li>

Competitor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">facilities</span></code> are specific to the Maximize Market Share and Target Market Share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types. Weight-The relative weighting of the facility, which is used to rate the attractiveness, desirability, or bias of one facility compared to another. For example, a value of 2.0 could capture the preference of customers who prefer, at a ratio of 2 to 1, shopping in one facility over another facility. Factors that potentially affect facility weight include square footage, neighborhood, and age of the building. Weight values other than one are only honored by the maximize market share and target market share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Capacity</span></code> - The Capacity field is specific to the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem type; the other problem types
ignore this field.  Capacity specifies how much weighted demand the facility is capable of supplying. Excess demand won’t
be allocated to a facility even if that demand is within the facility’s default measurement cutoff. Any value assigned to
the Capacity field overrides the Default Capacity parameter (Default_Capacity in Python) for the given facility.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> - Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at or depart from the facility. The field value is
specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Either side of vehicle)-The facility can be visited from either the right or left side of the vehicle.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Right side of vehicle)-Arrive at or depart the facility so that it is on the right side of the vehicle. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the right-hand side so that passengers can disembark at the curb.</p></li>
<li><p>2 (Left side of vehicle)-Arrive at or depart the facility so that it is on the left side of the vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs the facility, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle.

</ul>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and
left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless
of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision
to approach a facility  from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example,
if you want to arrive at a facility and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, you would choose Right side

line or lines if the demand point is part of the solution.  GroupName-The name of the group the demand point is part of.
This property is ignored for the maximize capacitated coverage, target market share, and maximize market share problem types.
If demand points share a group name, the solver allocates all members of the group to the same facility. (If constraints, such
as a cutoff distance, prevent any of the demand points in the group from reaching the same facility, none of the demand points
are allocated.) Weight-The relative weighting of the demand point. A value of 2.0 means the demand point is twice as important
as one with a weight of 1.0. If demand points represent households, weight could indicate the number of people in each household.
Cutoff_Time-The demand point can’t be allocated to a facility that is beyond the travel time indicated here. This field value
overrides the value of the Default Measurement Cutoff parameter.  The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement
Units parameter. The attribute value is referenced during the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Minimize</span> <span class="pre">Impedance</span></code>: This is also known as the P-Median problem type. Facilities are located such that the sum of all
weighted travel time or distance between demand points and solution facilities is minimized.
(Weighted travel is the amount of demand allocated to a facility multiplied by the travel distance or time to the facility.) This problem type is traditionally used to
locate warehouses, because it can reduce the overall transportation costs of delivering goods to outlets. Since Minimize Impedance reduces the overall distance the public
needs to travel to reach the chosen facilities, the minimize impedance problem without an impedance cutoff is ordinarily regarded as more equitable than other problem
types for locating some public-sector facilities such as libraries, regional airports, museums, department of motor vehicles offices, and health clinics.
The following list describes how the minimize impedance problem type handles demand:
* A demand point that cannot reach any facilities, due to setting a cutoff distance or time, is not allocated.
* A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
* A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Coverage</span></code>: Facilities are located such that as much demand as possible is allocated to solution facilities
within the impedance cutoff. Maximize Coverage is frequently used to locate fire stations, police stations, and ERS centers, because emergency services are often required to
arrive at all demand points within a specified response time. Note that it is important for all organizations, and critical for emergency services, to have accurate and precise data so that
analysis results correctly model real-world results. Pizza delivery businesses, as opposed to eat-in pizzerias, try to locate stores where they can cover the most people within a certain drive time.
People who order pizzas for delivery don’t typically worry about how far away the pizzeria is; they are mainly concerned with the pizza arriving within an advertised time window. Therefore, a
pizza-delivery business would subtract pizza-preparation time from their advertised delivery time and solve a maximize coverage problem to choose the candidate facility that would capture the most
potential customers in the coverage area. (Potential customers of eat-in pizzerias are more affected by distance, since they need to travel to the restaurant; thus, the attendance maximizing or
market share problem types would better suit eat-in restaurants.)
The following list describes how the Maximize Coverage problem handles demand:
* A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
* A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
* A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Capacitated</span> <span class="pre">Coverage</span></code>: Facilities are located such that all or the greatest amount of demand can be served without exceeding the capacity of any facility. Maximize
Capacitated Coverage behaves like  either the Minimize Impedance or Maximize Coverage problem type but with the added constraint of capacity. You can specify a capacity for an individual facility
by assigning a numeric value to  its corresponding Capacity field on the input facilities. If the Capacity field value is null, the facility is assigned a capacity from the Default Capacity property.
Use-cases for Maximize Capacitated Coverage include creating territories that encompass a given number of people or businesses, locating hospitals or other medical facilities with a limited number
of beds or patients who can be treated, or locating warehouses whose inventory isn’t assumed to be unlimited.
The following list describes how the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem handles demand:
* Unlike Maximize Coverage, Maximize Capacitated Coverage doesn’t require a value for the Default Measurement Cutoff; however, when an cutoff is specified, any demand point outside the cutoff time or distance of all facilities is not allocated.
* An allocated demand point has all or none of its demand weight assigned to a facility; that is, demand isn’t apportioned with this problem type.
* If the total demand that can reach a facility is greater than the capacity of the facility, only the demand points that maximize total captured demand and minimize total weighted travel are allocated.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You may notice an apparent inefficiency when a demand point is allocated to a facility that isn’t the  nearest solution facility. This may occur when demand points have varying weights and when the
demand point in question can reach more than one facility. This kind of result indicates the nearest solution facility didn’t have adequate capacity for the weighted demand, or the most efficient
solution for the entire problem required one or more local inefficiencies. In either case, the solution is correct.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Minimize</span> <span class="pre">Facilities</span></code>: Facilities are chosen such that as much weighted demand as
possible are allocated to solution facilities within the travel time or distance cutoff; additionally, the number of facilities required to cover demand is minimized. Minimize Facilities is the
same as Maximize Coverage but with the exception of the number of facilities to locate, which in this case is determined by the solver. When the cost of building facilities is not a limiting factor,
the same kinds of organizations that use Maximize Coverage (emergency response, for instance) use Minimize Facilities so that all possible demand points will be covered.
The following list describes how the Minimize Facilities problem handles demand:
* A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
* A demand point that can only  reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.
* A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Attendance</span></code>: Facilities are chosen such that as much demand weight as possible is allocated to facilities while
assuming the demand weight decreases in relation to the distance between the facility and the demand point. Specialty stores
that have little or no competition benefit from this problem type, but it may also be beneficial to general retailers and restaurants that
don’t have the data on competitors necessary to perform market share problem types. Some businesses that might benefit from this problem
type include coffee shops, fitness centers, dental and medical offices, and electronics stores. Public transit bus stops are often
chosen with the help of Maximize Attendance. Maximize Attendance assumes that the farther people have to travel to reach your facility,
the less likely they are to use it. This is reflected in how the amount of demand allocated to facilities diminishes with distance.
The following list describes how the Maximize Attendance problem handles demand:
* A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.
* When a demand point can reach a facility, its demand weight is only partially allocated to the facility. The amount allocated decreases as a function of the maximum cutoff distance (or time) and the travel distance (or time) between the facility and the demand point.
* The weight of a demand point that can reach more than one facility is proportionately allocated to the nearest facility only.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span> <span class="pre">Market</span> <span class="pre">Share</span></code>: A specific number of facilities are chosen such that the allocated demand is maximized in the presence
of competitors. The goal is to capture as much of the total market share as possible with a given number of facilities,
which you specify. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. The market share problem
types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight,
you also need to know that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type
can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive
information that includes competitor data. Large discount stores typically use  Maximize Market Share to locate a finite set of new stores.
The market share problem types use a Huff model, which is also known as a gravity model or spatial interaction.
The following list describes how the Maximize Market Share problem handles demand:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is
split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities’ attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to
the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights,
this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The total market share, which can be used to calculate the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Target</span> <span class="pre">Market</span> <span class="pre">Share</span></code>: Target Market Share chooses the minimum number of facilities necessary to capture a specific percentage
of the total market share in the presence of competitors. The total market share is the
sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. You set the percent of the market share you want to reach and let the solver choose
the fewest number of facilities necessary to meet that threshold.
The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight, you also need to know
that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use
the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive information that includes
competitor data. Large discount stores typically use the Target Market Share
problem type when they want to know how much expansion would be required to reach a certain level of the market share or see what strategy would be needed just to maintain their current market share given the introduction
of new competing facilities. The results often represent what stores would like to do if budgets weren’t a concern. In other cases where budget is a concern, stores revert to the Maximize Market Share problem and
simply capture as much of the market share as possible with a limited number of facilities.
The following list describes how the target market share problem handles demand:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The total market share, which is used in calculating the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated.</p></li>
<li><p>A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility.</p></li>

<p>Travel times and distances may change based on direction of travel. If going from point A to point B,
you may encounter less traffic or have a shorter path, due to one-way streets and turn restrictions,
than if you were traveling in the opposite direction. For instance, going from point A to point B may
only take 10 minutes, but going the other direction may take 15 minutes. These differing measurements may
affect whether demand points can be assigned to certain facilities because of cutoffs or, in problem types
where demand is apportioned, affect how much demand is captured. Fire departments commonly measure from
facilities to demand points since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station
to the location of the emergency. A retail store is more concerned with the time it takes shoppers to reach
the store; therefore, stores commonly measure from demand points to facilities. Travel Direction also

If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.
The service supports the restriction names listed in the following table:</p>

Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle
for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits,
avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this
parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly
prefer them.
The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for ParameterName used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.
Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.
In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PROHIBITED</span></code> (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_HIGH</span></code> (5) - It is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_MEDIUM</span></code> (2) - It is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_LOW</span></code> (1.3) - It is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_LOW</span></code> (0.8) - It is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_MEDIUM</span></code> (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_HIGH</span></code> (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>allocation_line_shape</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. The default is to output straight lines.</p>
<p>Specify the type of line features that are output by the
tool. The parameter accepts one of the following
values:
Straight Line: Return straight lines between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them. This is the default.  Drawing straight lines on a map helps you visualize how demand is allocated. None: Return a table containing data about the shortest paths between solution facilities and the demand points allocated to them, but don’t return lines.
No matter which value you choose for the Allocation Line Shape
parameter, the shortest route is always determined by minimizing the
travel time or the travel distance, never using the straight-line
distance between demand points and
facilities. That is, this parameter only changes the output line shapes; it doesn’t change the measurement method.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>travel_mode</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your
organization to better reflect your organization’s workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model traveling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling

Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian.

<dd><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generate_origin_destination_cost_matrix</span></code> tool creates an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations.
An OD cost matrix is a table that contains the travel time and travel distance from each origin to each destination. Additionally, it ranks the
destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum time or distance required to travel from that origin to each
destination. The best path on the street network is discovered for each origin-destination pair, and the travel times and travel distances are
stored as attributes of the output lines. Even though the lines are straight for performance reasons, they always store the travel time and travel
distance along the street network, not straight-line distance.</p>

When specifying the origins, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or the number of destinations

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code> - The name of the origin. The name can be an unique identifier for the origin. The name is included in the output lines (as the OriginName field) and in the output origins (as the Name field) and can be used to join additional information from the tool outputs to the attributes of your origins.

organization to better reflect your organization’s workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>0 (Restriction)-Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.

<li><p>1 (Scaled Cost)-Scales the time or distance required to travel the
underlying streets by a factor specified using the ScaledTimeFactor
or ScaledDistanceFactor fields. If the streets are partially
covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This

Checked (True): Use hierarchy when finding routes. When hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order  streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on
freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, since the tool can determine the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.
Unchecked (False):
Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short routes within a city.</p>
<p>The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
straight-line distance between facilities and demand points is
greater than 50 miles (80.46
kilometers), even if you have set this parameter to not use hierarchy.
This parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. When modeling a custom walking mode,
it is recommended to turn off hierarchy since the hierarchy is designed for motorized vehicles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.
A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads to be
prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads
restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel
on toll roads in order to visit a stop. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances
that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle,
using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked
as illegal to do so. The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to
Custom. Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available
in the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also
ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value
parameter). It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

<td><p>Optional <a class="reference internal" href="arcgis.features.toc.html#arcgis.features.FeatureSet" title="arcgis.features.FeatureSet"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FeatureSet</span></code></a>  . Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle
for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits,
avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this
parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly
prefer them.
The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code> used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.
Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.
In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PROHIBITED</span></code> (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_HIGH</span></code> (5) - It is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_MEDIUM</span></code> (2) - It is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVOID_LOW</span></code> (1.3) - It is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_LOW</span></code> (0.8) - It is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_MEDIUM</span></code> (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PREFER_HIGH</span></code> (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string.  Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along
road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance
in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change
is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this
is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a
mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk
the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.
Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are
dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. Truck Time-Models
travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. This is
the default value. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements
along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction
parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate
restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this
parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the
Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance,
Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

“value2”}. The override setting name is always enclosed in double quotes. The values can be a number, Boolean,

<dd><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">find_routes</span></code> determines the shortest paths to visit the input stops and
returns the driving directions, information about the visited stops,
and the route paths, including travel time and distance. The tool is
capable of finding routes that visit several input stops in a sequence
you predetermine or in the  sequence that minimizes overall travel. You
can group the input stops into different routes using the RouteName
field, and the tool will output one route for each group of stops,
allowing you to generate routes for many vehicles in a single solve
operation.</p>

or routes to visit. You can add up to 10,000 stops and assign up to 150 stops to a single
route. (Assign stops to routes using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> attribute). When specifying the stops,
you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
attributes.
The stops can be specified with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>: The name of the stop. This name is used when generating driving directions. It is common to pass the name of a business, person, or street address at the stop. If a value is not specified, an automatically generated name such as Location 1 or Location 2 is assigned to each stop.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>: The earliest time the stop can be visited. Specify this attribute if you want to limit when
a route can arrive at a stop; for instance, you may want to make deliveries to a restaurant between
busy lunch and dinner hours (for example, sometime between 2:00 and 4:30 p.m.) to facilitate the work
for you and the restaurant staff.</p>
<p>The value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970).</p>
<p>This value can be specified either in UTC or local time, depending on the value given for
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeWindowsAreUTC</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you specify this attribute, you also need to specify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> attribute.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>: The latest time the stop can be visited. Together, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code>
attributes make up the time window within which a route can visit the stop. As with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code>,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since
epoch (January 1, 1970) and is interpreted as UTC or local time, depending on the value specified for
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timeWindowsAreUTC</span></code> parameter.</p>
<p>The time window specified using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowStart</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeWindowEnd</span></code> attributes is not considered a hard
constraint by the service. That is, the service doesn’t fail if the stop cannot be visited during the time
window; instead, the service tries to find a route that visits the stop during its time window, but if time
window violations are inevitable, the service tries to find a solution that minimizes the time-window violation
time for all stops in the problem.</p>
<p>If a route has to arrive early at the stop, a wait time is added to the total travel time of the route.
Similarly, if the route arrives late at the stop, a violation time is added to the total travel time of
the route. For example, If the time window on the stop is set as 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and the earliest a
route can reach the stop is 11:25 AM, a violation of 25 minutes is added to the total travel time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code>: The name of the route to which the stop belongs. Use this attribute to group stops into different
routes and, therefore, solve multiple routes in a single request. For example, if you want to find two distinct
routes - a route with 4 stops and another with 6 stops - set RouteName to Route1 for each of the four stops and Route2
for each of the 6 stops. The service will produce two distinct routes and driving directions for each group of
stops in a single request.</p>
<p>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> is not specified for any stops, all stops belong to the same route. If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RouteName</span></code> is not
specified for some stops, those stops are treated as unassigned and are not included in any route.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span></code>: The output routes will visit the stops in the order you specify with this
attribute. Within a group of stops that have the same RouteName value, the sequence
number should be greater than 0 but not greater than the total number of stops. Also, the
sequence number should not be duplicated. If Reorder Stops To Find Optimal Routes is
checked (True), all but possibly the first and last sequence values for each route name
are ignored so the tool can find the sequence that minimizes overall travel for each
route. (The settings for Preserve Ordering of Stops and Return to Start determine whether
the first or last sequence values for each route are ignored.)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code>: Specify the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the stop. One of the
integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this
attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for the CurbApproach attribute
values that you may have come across when using ArcGIS Network Analyst extension extension software.</p>

can be chosen if it is possible and desirable for your vehicle to turn
around at the stop. This decision may depend on the width of the road and

can pull in and turn around.</p></td>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand
traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a stop on the left side of a vehicle.
It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What
may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach from the right or left side. For example,
if you want to arrive at a stop and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the stop, you would choose
Right side of vehicle in the United States but Left side of vehicle in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_TravelTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for cars, in minutes, that will be spent at the stop when
the route visits it. This attribute can be used to model the time required to provide some kind of service
while you are at the stop. It can also be used to specify some additional time required to reach the actual
location on the street from where the route starts or time required to reach the actual destination location
from the location on the street where the route ends. The value for this attribute is included in the total
travel time for the route and is also displayed in driving directions as service time. A zero or null value
indicates that the stop requires no service time.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are finding the best route through three stops. Suppose it requires 2 minutes to
walk to the street location from where the route starts, you need to spend 10 minutes at Stop 2, and it takes 5
minutes to walk from the street location to the destination. The Attr_TravelTime attribute should be given
values of 2, 10, and 5 for Stop 1, Stop 2, and Stop 3, respectively. If it takes 10 minutes to travel from Stop
1 to Stop 2 and 10 minutes to travel from Stop 2 to Stop 3, the total travel time to reach Stop 3 is displayed
as 37 minutes (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5), even though there is only 20 minutes of traveling to reach Stop 3.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_TruckTravelTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for trucks, in minutes, that will be added to the total
travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the stop.</p>
<p>The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in
driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time.
The default value is 0.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_WalkTime</span></code>: Specify the amount of time for pedestrians, in minutes, that will be added to the total
travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the incident.
The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in
driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time.
The default value is 0.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_Miles</span></code>: Specify the distance in miles that will be added when calculating total distance of the route.
Generally the locations of the stops are not exactly on the streets but are set back somewhat from the road.
The Attr_Miles attribute can be used to model the distance between the actual stop location and its location
on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Attr_Kilometers</span></code>: Specify the distance in kilometers that will be added when calculating total
distance of the route. Generally the locations of the stops are not exactly on the streets but are set back

restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be
required to travel on the underlying streets. For example, a point
barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a street or
time delay spent at a railroad crossing.</p>
<p>The tool imposes a limit of 250 points that can be added
as barriers.
When specifying the point barriers, you can set properties for each one,
such as its name or barrier type, by using attributes. The point barriers
can be specified with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code>: The name of the barrier.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BarrierType</span></code>: Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value for this attribute is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
* 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a restriction.
* 2 (Added Cost) - Traveling through the barrier increases the travel time or distance by the amount specified in the Additional_Time or Additional_Distance field. This barrier type is referred to as an added-cost point barrier.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Additional_Time</span></code>: Indicates how much travel time is added when the
barrier is traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost
barriers and only if the measurement units are time based. This field
value must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
Measurement Units parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Additional_Distance</span></code>: Indicates how much distance is added when the barrier is
traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers
and only if the measurement units are distance based. The field value
must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
Measurement Units parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Additional_Cost</span></code>: Indicates how much cost is added when the barrier is traversed.
This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers and only if the travel mode used
for the analysis uses an impedance attribute that is neither time-based or distance-based.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FullEdge</span></code>: Specify how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements
during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the
numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (False): Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier, but not through it. This is the default value.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (True): Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code>: Specifies the direction of traffic that is affected by the barrier.
The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code,
not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0 (Either side of vehicle): The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Right side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their right
side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier
on their left side are not affected by the barrier.</p></li>
<li><p>2 (Left side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their left side
during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their
right side are not affected by the barrier.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since junctions are points and don’t have a side, barriers on junctions affect all vehicles
regardless of the curb approach.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurbApproach</span></code> property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards:
right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a
facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether
the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving
standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it
ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility
and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of
vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bearing</span></code>: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise
from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the BearingTol field.</p>
<p>Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver.
Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.</p>
<p>Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle
is near an intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side
of the street the point is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BearingTol</span></code>: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving
points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the range of acceptable
values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180.
A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an edge,
a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and
in both digitized directions of the edge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code>: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and BearingTol also have values;
however, entering a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and BearingTol.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a
moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle’s navigation device.</p>
<p>The time units of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NavLatency</span></code> are the same as the units specified by the timeUnits property of the analysis object.</p>

covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>use_hierarchy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best routes.</p>
<p>Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets, such as
freeways, to lower-order streets, such as local roads, and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn’t
prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
used when finding short-distance routes within a city.</p>
<p>The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
straight-line distance between orders, depots, or orders and depots is
greater than 50 miles, even if you have set this parameter to not use hierarchy.

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.  The value you provide for this parameter
is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include
roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility.
Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle.
If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling
the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.</p>
<p>Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code> column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code> field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.</p>
<p>Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below.
Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available
in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis
services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select
availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in
the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores
restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter).
It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

essential shape of the route and removes other points. The
simplification distance you specify is the maximum allowable offset
that the simplified line can deviate from the original line.
Simplifying a line reduces the number of vertices that are part of

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetTravelModes</span></code> tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.

Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance.
Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to
choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models
travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel

values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot,
all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time
zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window
values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
eastern standard time.</p>
<p>UTC: The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone
in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first
time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m.
and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time. Specifying the date-time values
in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time
zones, and you want all the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset
defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as GEO_LOCAL.</p>

<p>This <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generate_service_areas</span></code> tool determines network service areas around facilities. A network service area is a region that
encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more facilities. For instance, the
10-minute service area for a facility includes all the streets that can be reached within 10 minutes from that facility. Service areas
are commonly used to visualize and measure accessibility. For example, a three-minute drive-time polygon around a grocery store can
determine which residents are able to reach the store within three minutes and are thus more likely to shop there.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>break_values</p></td>
<td><p>Required string. Specifies the size and number of service area
polygons to generate for each facility. The units are determined by the Break Units value.</p>
<p>Multiple polygon breaks can be set to create concentric service areas per facility. For
instance, to find 2-, 3-, and 5-mile service areas for each facility, type 2 3 5, separating
the values with a space, and set Break Units to Miles. There is no limit to the number of
break values you specify.</p>
<p>The size of the maximum break value can’t exceed the equivalent of 300 minutes or 300 miles
(482.80 kilometers). When generating detailed polygons, the maximum service-area size is
limited to 15 minutes and 15 miles (24.14 kilometers).</p>
</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>break_units</p></td>
<td><p>Required string. The unit for the Break Values parameter. The units
you choose for this parameter determine whether the tool will create service areas by
measuring driving distance or driving time. Choose a time unit to measure driving time. To
measure driving distance, choose a distance unit. Your choice also determines in which units
the tool will report total driving time or distance in the results. The choices are: Meters

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>analysis_region</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the region in which to perform the
analysis. If a value is not specified for this parameter, the tool will automatically
calculate the region name based on the location of the input points. Setting the name of the
region is recommended to speed up the tool execution.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Away</span> <span class="pre">From</span> <span class="pre">Facility</span></code> - The service area is generated in the direction away from the facilities.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The direction of travel may change the shape of the polygons because impedances on opposite
sides of streets may differ or one-way restrictions may exist, such as one-way streets. The
direction you should choose depends on the nature of your service area analysis. The service
area for a pizza delivery store, for example, should be created away from the facility,
whereas the service area of a hospital should be created toward the facility.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>time_of_day</p></td>
<td><p>Optional datetime. The time to depart from or arrive at the
facilities. The interpretation of this value depends on whether travel is toward or away from
the facilities.
It represents the departure time if Travel Direction is set to Away from Facility.
It represents the arrival time if Travel Direction is set to Toward Facility.</p>
<p>You can use the Time Zone for Time of Day parameter to specify whether this time and date
refers to UTC or the time zone in which the facility is located.</p>
<p>Repeatedly solving the same analysis, but using different Time of Day values, allows you to see
how a facility’s reach changes over time. For instance, the five-minute service area around a
fire station may start out large in the early morning, diminish during the morning rush hour,
grow in the late morning, and so on, throughout the day.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>use_hierarchy</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when
finding the best route between the facility and the incident.</p>
<p>Checked (True) - Use the hierarchy attribute for the analysis. Using a hierarchy results in the
solver preferring higher-order edges to lower-order edges. Hierarchical solves are faster, and
they can be used to simulate the preference of a driver who chooses to travel on freeways over
local roads when possible-even if that means a longer trip.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False) - Do not use the hierarchy attribute for the analysis. Not using a hierarchy
yields an accurate service area measured along all edges of the network dataset regardless of
hierarchy level.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Use Hierarchy parameter is checked (True), hierarchy is always used when
the largest break value exceeds 240 minutes or 240 miles (386.24 kilometers).</p>

moment the following terminology: a junction is a point where a street segment ends and potentially
connects to one or more other segments; a pseudo-junction is a point where exactly two streets
connect to one another; an intersection is a point where three or more streets connect; and a
dead-end is where one street segment ends without connecting to another. Given this information, the

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rings</span></code> - The polygons representing larger breaks exclude the polygons of smaller breaks.
This creates polygons going between consecutive breaks. Use this option if you want to
find the area from one break to another. For instance, if you create 5- and 10-minute
service areas, then the 10-minute service area polygon will exclude the area under the
5-minute service area polygon. This is the default value.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Disks</span></code> - Creates polygons going from the facility to the break. For instance, if you
create 5- and 10-minute service areas, then the 10-minute service area polygon will

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>detailed_polygons</p></td>
<td><p>Optional boolean. Specifies the option to create detailed or generalized
polygons.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False) - Creates generalized polygons, which are
generated quickly and are fairly accurate. This is the
default.</p>
<p>Checked (True) - Creates detailed polygons, which
accurately model the service area lines and may contain islands of
unreached areas. This option is much slower than generating
generalized polygons. This option isn’t supported when using
hierarchy.
If your facilities are in an urban area with a grid-like street network,
the difference between generalized and detailed service areas would be
minimal. However, if your facilities are in a region containing mountain
and rural roads, the detailed service areas may present significantly
more accurate results than generalized service areas.</p>

polygons are trimmed. This is useful when finding service areas in
places that have a sparse street network and you don’t want the
service area to cover large areas where there are no street
features.</p>
<p>The default value is 100 meters. No value or a value of 0 for this parameter
specifies that the service area polygons should not be trimmed. This
parameter value is ignored when using hierarchy.</p>
</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>polygon_simplification_tolerance</p></td>

simplify the polygon geometry.</p>
<p>Simplification maintains critical vertices of a polygon to define its essential
shape and removes other vertices. The simplification distance you specify is the
maximum offset the simplified polygon boundaries can deviate from the original
polygon boundaries. Simplifying a polygon reduces the number of vertices and tends
to reduce drawing times.</p>

integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>0 (Restriction) - Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier
is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a
restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>2 (Added Cost) - Traveling through the barrier increases the travel
time or distance by the amount specified in the Additional_Time or

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BarrierType</span></code>: Specifies whether the barrier restricts travel completely or scales the time or distance for traveling through it. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>0 (Restriction) - Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.
The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it
prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use
of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the
street that make traveling on those streets impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>1 (Scaled Cost) - Scales the time or distance required to travel the
underlying streets by a factor specified using the ScaledTimeFactor
or ScaledDistanceFactor fields. If the streets are partially
covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This
barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>restrictions</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes
between facilities and demand points. A restriction represents a driving
preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will
include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an
incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are
lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using
the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as
illegal to do so.
Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in
the list below. Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether
the restriction is available in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section
of the Data coverage for network analysis services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the
Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country.
If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located,
the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage
parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions
whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.
The service supports the restriction names listed in the following table:</p>

restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute
parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the
restriction. If the restriction is meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
to which they are avoided or preferred using this parameter. For example, you can choose to never use
toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly prefer them.</p>
<p>The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you specify
the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a  feature class, the field names on the feature class must
match the fields as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeName</span></code>: Lists the name of the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterName</span></code>: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the
restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
values based on its intended use.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ParameterValue</span></code>: The value for ParameterName used by the tool
when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is
applicable only if the restriction name is specified as the value for the Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel
on the roads associated with the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of the following string values or
their equivalent numeric values listed within the parentheses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PROHIBITED (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_HIGH (5) - It is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2) - It is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>AVOID_LOW (1.3) - It is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_LOW (0.8) - It is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are associated with the restriction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED, for the Restriction Usage if the restriction
is dependent on a vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some cases, the value for
Restriction Usage depends on your routing preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction
has the default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter. This means that when the
restriction is used, the tool will try to route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best route; it has a medium priority. Choosing
AVOID_LOW would put lower importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would give it a higher
importance and thus make it more acceptable for the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls.
Choosing PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it impossible for a route to
travel on any portion of a toll road. Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast, others prefer to drive on toll roads
because avoiding traffic is more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter case, you
would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the
preference, the farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads associated with the
restriction.</p>

parameter.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Geographically</span> <span class="pre">Local</span></code>: The Time of Day parameter refers to the time zone or zones in which the facilities
are located. Therefore, the start or end times of the service areas are staggered by time zone. Setting
Time of Day to 9:00 a.m., choosing geographically local for Time Zone for Time of Day, and solving causes
service areas to be generated for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone,
9:00 a.m. Central Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 9:00 a.m. Mountain Time for facilities in
the Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. If stores in a chain that span
the U.S. open at 9:00 a.m. local time, this parameter value could be chosen to find market territories at
opening time for all stores in one solve. First, the stores in the Eastern Time Zone open and a polygon is
generated, then an hour later stores open in Central Time, and so on. Nine o’clock is always in local time
but staggered in real time.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UTC</span></code>: The Time of Day parameter refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Therefore, all facilities are reached or departed from simultaneously, regardless of the time zone each is
in. Setting Time of Day to 2:00 p.m., choosing UTC, then solving causes service areas to be generated for
9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone, 8:00 a.m. Central Standard
Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 7:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time for facilities in the
Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. The scenario above assumes standard
time. During daylight saving time, the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Times would each be one hour ahead
(that is, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00 a.m., respectively). One of the cases in which the UTC option is useful is
to visualize emergency-response coverage for a jurisdiction that is split into two time zones. The emergency
vehicles are loaded as facilities. Time of Day is set to now in UTC. (You need to determine what  the current
time and date are  in terms of UTC to correctly use this option.) Other properties are set and the analysis
is solved. Even though a time-zone boundary divides the vehicles, the results show areas that can be reached
given current traffic conditions. This same process  can be used for other times as well, not just for now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Irrespective of the Time Zone for Time of Day setting, all facilities must be in the same time zone
when Time of Day has a nonnull value and Polygons for Multiple Facilities is set to create merged or
nonoverlapping polygons.</p>

<td><p>Optional string.  Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel
modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better

organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox
available under the same GIS Server connection you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool
adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode
Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the tool does not have to lookup the settings
based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p>The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode
parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose
Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this
to try out different settings to get desired analysis results. Once you have identified the analysis settings,
you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>impedance</p></td>
<td><p>Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost
of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel
distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car.
(What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance
between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car
may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian
may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for
the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times
for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data
is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are
static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel
Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and
ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel
Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted
to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the
default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set
to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>exclude_sources_from_polygon_generation</p></td>
<td><p>Optional list of strings. You can exclude certain network dataset edge sources when
generating service area polygons. Polygons will not be generated around
the excluded sources, even though they are traversed in the analysis.
Excluding a network source from service area polygons does not prevent
those sources from being traversed. Excluding sources from service area
polygons only influences the shape of the service area polygons.
To prevent traversal of a given network source, you must create an appropriate
restriction when defining your network dataset.This is useful if you have some
network sources that you don’t want included in the polygon generation because
they create less accurate polygons or are inconsequential for the service area
analysis. For example, when creating a walk-time service area in a multimodal
network that includes streets and metro lines, you should choose to exclude
the metro lines from polygon generation. Although travelers can use the metro
lines, they cannot stop partway along a metro line and enter a nearby building.
Instead, they must travel the full length of the metro line, exit the metro system at
a station, and use the streets to walk to the building. Generating a polygon
feature around a metro line will be inaccurate.</p>
